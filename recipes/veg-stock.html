    <p>A light, flavorful liquid made by simmering 
        a combination of vegetables, herbs, and water. 
        Common ingredients include onions, carrots, 
        celery, garlic, and bay leaves, gently cooked to
        extract their essence without overpowering the 
        stock. This clear, aromatic base is perfect for
        soups, stews, risottos, and sauces, offering a 
        vegetarian-friendly alternative to meat-based 
        stocks.
