    <p>If you're confused about what exactly curry powder is, you're not alone. 
        There are countless variations in flavor, brand, and colorâ€” no two curry 
        powders seem to be the same. The orange-hued spice is used in a host of 
        dishes, from deviled eggs to dry rubs to roasted sweet potatoes. Curry, a 
        blanket term adopted by British colonists to describe a vast range of 
        Indian flavors and dishes, actually refers to a saucy meat and vegetable 
        meal, often tomato or coconut-based. And while curry powder isn't used 
        in traditional Indian cooking, it's made an indelible mark on Western
        palates and spice cabinets.

        Curry powders usually consist of turmeric, cumin, ginger, and black pepper.
        Some blends also incorporate garlic and cinnamon. What all curry powders 
        share is a sweet warmth and pleasant pungency that adds a toasty depth to 
        everything it touches.
